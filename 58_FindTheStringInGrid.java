Question:
Given a 2D grid of n*m of characters and a word, find all occurrences of given word in grid. A word can be matched in all 8 directions at any point. 
Word is said to be found in a direction if all characters match in this direction (not in zig-zag form). 
The 8 directions are, horizontally left, horizontally right, vertically up, vertically down, and 4 diagonal directions.

Note: The returning list should be lexicographically smallest. 
If the word can be found in multiple directions starting from the same coordinates, the list should contain the coordinates only once. 

Example 1:

Input: 
grid = {{a,b,c},{d,r,f},{g,h,i}},
word = "abc"
Output: 
{{0,0}}
Explanation: 
From (0,0) we can find "abc" in horizontally right direction.

Example 2:

Input: 
grid = {{a,b,a,b},{a,b,e,b},{e,b,e,b}}
word = "abe"
Output: 
{{0,0},{0,2},{1,0}}
Explanation: 
From (0,0) we can find "abe" in right-down diagonal. 
From (0,2) we can find "abe" in left-down diagonal. 
From (1,0) we can find "abe" in horizontally right direction.

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything, 
Your task is to complete the function searchWord() 
which takes grid and word as input parameters and returns a list containing the positions from where the word originates in any direction. 
If there is no such position then returns an empty list.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n*m*k) where k is constant
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= m <= 50
1 <= |word| <= 15

/* 
Understanding the Problem Statement:
- You are given a 2D grid of characters.
- You are also given a word.
- The task is to find all occurrences of the word in the grid, checking in all 8 possible directions.
- The valid directions include:
    - Horizontally right
    - Horizontally left
    - Vertically up
    - Vertically down
    - 4 diagonal directions (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
- We need to return a list of coordinates from where the word starts in the grid, considering the directions mentioned.
- The coordinates must be lexicographically smallest, meaning that if two positions are found with the same word but in different directions, 
  only the first (lexicographically smaller) one should be kept.
- If no occurrence is found, return an empty list.

What is being asked:
- Implement the function `searchWord(grid, word)` 
  which returns a list of coordinates (row, column) where the word is found in the grid in any of the 8 directions.

*/

/* 
Extracting Information from the Problem Statement:
1. Input data type:
   - The input consists of a 2D array (grid) of size `n x m`, where each element is a character.
   - The input also includes a string `word` whose occurrences need to be found in the grid.
   
2. Expected Output:
   - The function should return a list of coordinates where the word starts in the grid, considering all 8 directions.

3. Output return type:
   - The return type should be a list of coordinate pairs, each representing the starting point of the word.

4. Time complexity expectations:
   - The time complexity should be O(n * m * k), where `k` is a constant that represents the length of the word (which is â‰¤ 15). 
     We will check each potential starting position and each direction.
   
5. Constraints:
   - The grid can have a maximum size of 50x50, and the length of the word is at most 15 characters.
   - The problem allows for up to 50 * 50 possible starting positions, and for each, we need to check 8 possible directions.
*/

/* 
Thinking Solution for the Problem Statement:
1. Identification Part:
   - This is a grid search problem where we need to check every possible direction from each cell for the given word.
   - We can use a helper function that checks if the word matches from a given starting point in a particular direction.
   
2. Destructuring:
   - Start from each cell in the grid and check in all 8 possible directions.
   - For each direction, check if the word can be found by iterating through the grid from the current position.
   - If the word is found, add the starting coordinates to the result list.
   
3. Conversational solution into smaller subtask:
   - Subtask 1: Loop over all the grid cells (n x m).
   - Subtask 2: For each cell, check all 8 directions.
   - Subtask 3: For each direction, check if the word can be formed by looking at subsequent grid positions.
   - Subtask 4: If the word is found, store the starting coordinates.
   - Subtask 5: Sort the coordinates lexicographically and return them.

*/

/* 
Conversional Solution into Subtasks:
1. Loop over all grid cells.
2. For each grid cell, check if the word can be formed in any of the 8 directions:
   - Use helper functions to check all 8 directions.
3. For each direction, check the word formation by matching characters in the grid.
4. If the word is found, store the position.
5. Sort the positions lexicographically and return.

*/

/* 
Subtasks of Conversional Solution into Code:
1. Create a helper function `isWordFound()` to check if the word can be found in a particular direction.
2. Loop over each grid cell and for each cell, check all 8 directions.
3. Store valid positions where the word is found.
4. Return the sorted positions as the result.

/* 
Time and Space Complexity Explanation:
Time Complexity:
- We iterate over all grid cells, which is O(n * m).
- For each cell, we check 8 possible directions, and for each direction, we check a word of length `k` (max 15).
- Thus, the time complexity is O(n * m * k), where `k` is the length of the word, which is constant (<=15).

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space for checking directions, 
  and the space used for storing results does not depend on the grid size.

*/

/* 
For Loop Walkthrough:
- The outer `for` loop iterates through each cell in the grid (n * m).
- For each cell, the inner `for` loop checks the 8 directions for matching the word.
- If the word is found in any direction, the starting position is added to the result list.
- The result list is sorted lexicographically before returning.

Complete Code Walkthrough:
- We start by looping through every cell in the grid.
- For each cell, we check the 8 possible directions for the word.
- If the word matches in a direction, the starting position is added to the result list.
- After checking all cells, we sort the result list lexicographically.
- Finally, the result is returned.
