1.Understanding the Problem Statement: 
2.Extracting Information from the Problem Statement:
  - Input data type -
  - Expected Output -
  - Output return type - 
  - Time complexity expectations if any - 
  - Understanding the Constraints -
3.Thinking Solution for the Problem Statement:
  -Identification Part: Identify the Type of Problem - Recognize patterns
      - Searching (binary search, linear search)
      - Sorting (quick sort, merge sort)
      - Greedy algorithms (minimizing/maximizing)
      - Dynamic programming (overlapping subproblems, memoization)
      - Graph problems (BFS, DFS, shortest path)
      - Recursion or backtracking (divide and conquer)
  - Destructure:
    Destructure the given problem statement into simple words to get the intution for conversional solution by asking how i am going to solve the question.
  - After Finding out Solution in conversional manner and than breaking the conversional solution into smaller subtask.
  - Complete all the smaller subtask and Combine all the Subtask into solution.

4.Thinking into Code Converting:
  - Choose the Right Data Structures.
  - Design the Algorithm with respect to Edge Cases
     - Consider cases where the input is
       for Example
       - Empty arrays, lists, or strings.
       - Arrays with only one element.
       - Arrays where no solution exists.
       - Negative numbers, zeros, very large or very small numbers.
       - Explicitly test and handle these cases in your solution.
         The above are some example

    - Convert the smaller Subproblems into code.
    - Combine all the smaller Subproblems code for the Complete Solution.
